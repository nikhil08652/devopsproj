The main objective of the project is the implementation of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery using the Amazon web services and has been implemented by developing a blog using the Django framework. In this project, I have created a blog, where a user can register themselves and write some blogs and those blogs can be viewed by other users(registered/unregistered). Itâ€™s a very basic website to demonstrate the CI/CD. As soon as some changes are pushed to the GitHub repository, the CI/CD pipeline immediately gets into action and gets the modified data from the source i.e. GitHub in this case. After getting the files, a new build is triggered and if everything is alright, the build is deployed to the Elastic Beanstalk. The pushed changes are now live within a few minutes. I have also used pylint for static code analysis and the build is only deployed if the code is well written and does not have many flaws in it.
